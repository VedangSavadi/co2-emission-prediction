🚗 Predicting Car CO2 Emissions with Regression (Python, Jupyter Notebook)

As a Data Scientist, I undertook an exciting project to develop a predictive model for car CO2 emissions. Leveraging the power of Python and Jupyter Notebook, I applied regression techniques to analyze and forecast CO2 emissions based on various factors.

📊 Key Project Highlights:

✅ Data Exploration: I conducted thorough data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing to ensure the quality of the dataset, identifying relevant features, and handling missing values.

📈 Regression Modeling: Utilizing regression techniques including Linear Regression, multi-linear Regression, and logistic Regression, I built and fine-tuned predictive models to accurately estimate CO2 emissions.

📉 Model Evaluation: I employed industry-standard metrics to evaluate model performance, ensuring robust predictions and identifying the most effective regression approach.

📊 Data Visualization: I used data visualization libraries to create insightful charts and graphs that aided in understanding the relationships between variables and model results.

🔍 Insightful Analysis: The project provided valuable insights into the factors that impact CO2 emissions in cars, contributing to environmental awareness and sustainable transportation solutions.

📝 Jupyter Notebook: The entire project was documented in Jupyter Notebook, providing transparency and enabling reproducibility for future analyses.

This project exemplifies my passion for data-driven decision-making and my proficiency in using Python for predictive analytics. It's a testament to my commitment to addressing real-world challenges through data science and machine learning.
